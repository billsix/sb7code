OpenGL SuperBible 7th Edition Examples - How to Build
=====================================================

This source code archive uses CMake to build. The samples also use GLFW library.
Instructions for each supported
platform are as follows:

Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
--------------------------------------

Install CMake. Windows binaries are available from http://www.cmake.org/.
Ensure that CMake is in your path.
Open a command prompt and change to the directory where you've checked out the code.

### Build the samples

Open a command prompt and change to the build directory in the source archive.
Type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..

Open the resulting superbible7.sln project in Visual Studio.

The examples will build into the `bin` directory.

Linux
-----

As with Windows, the project uses CMake to create build files. You'll
need to install it with the appropriate method for your distribution. On
Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu and Mint):

    sudo apt-get install cmake

You'll also need to satisfy dependencies. In particular, you'll need GL and
GLX headers and libs (generally included in Mesa packages), and GLFW.

Once you have everything, you should enter the "build" directory in the source
arvhive and issue:

    cmake ..
    make

The examples will build into the 'bin' directory.

Other platforms
---------------

The code will probably build for other platforms, especially if they are
relatively non-obscure, but nothing besides Windows/Visual Studio and Linux
has been tested. It's up to you to find a capable OpenGL 4.x driver for
your platform of choice. CMake should also be able to build the appropriate
project files for environments such as Code::Blocks and Eclipse, but again,
this is untested.


*Please note carefully: EVEN IF YOU CAN BUILD THE SOURCES FOR YOUR FAVORITE
PLATFORM OF CHOICE, YOU NEED RECENT OpenGL 4.x DRIVERS TO RUN THEM. PLEASE
DON'T PAN THE BOOK BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T SUPPORT OpenGL 4.x. THANKS*
